<h2 id="beagle">What is a Beagle?</h2>

<p>What are beagles? Beagles are a white, brown, and black dog breed. They are a master at smelling, and they were breeded for hunting 
rabbits, but don't worry they are completely stranger friendly. Beagles are simmilar and unique to other dogs in so many different ways. 
But what really seprates a beagle is it's one of a kind nose. It sense of smell is so strong that beagles are known as a "nose with feet."

 <p>Beagles have an amazing sense of smell. Beagles can smell way better than humans. They have 220 million scent 
    receptors. People only have 5 million scent receptors. That's why beagles can smell stuff much better than humans.  
    When a beagle's long ears come near their nose it helps them smell better. Beagles were bred with scent hounds to 
    hunt small animals, mostly rabbits.</p>

<p>Since Beagles have a great sense of smell so they would make a great working dogs. Most beagles have jobs. 
Some beagles work in "Bedbug Detectors."  Some beagles work in airports. A less common job was polar bear pregnancy 
detector. There was two year old beagle named Elvis who was able to tell by smelling polar bear poop if they're pregnant. 
Elvis had a 97% accuracy. </p>

<p>Beagles are great at hunting. When fox hunting was popular, breeders made the beagle which was very good at hunting foxes. 
    Some beagles have "white-tipped tails." The "white-tipped tail" was there so they could be visible when they hunt with their 
    nose on the ground. Many people also learn who to rabbit hunt from beagles.

<p style="text-align: right;">Beagles sleep for about 10-12 hours a day, if theyâ€™re puppies then they sleep for 18-20 hours a day. Since puppies sleep much 
    longer than dogs, they are more playful. They could also sleep longer since they are small and get tired easily. Since beagles
    sleep so much in the day, guess how playful they are when they get up?</p>
